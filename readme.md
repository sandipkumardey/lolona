## 💡 The Problem It Solves  
Too many young people grow up surrounded by **silence, stigma, and shame** around the most basic aspects of their lives — periods, consent, identity.  
Traditional resources are either:  

- **Unreadable** (text-heavy, jargon-filled)  
- **Unavailable** (no safe channels in rural areas)  
- **Unsafe** (lack of privacy on shared devices)  

Lolona solves this by creating a **trusted, voice-first experience**:  

- Speaks your language, with local context and cultural nuance  
- Provides science, stories, and tips through natural conversations  
- Ensures privacy, dignity, and safety at every step  

This isn’t just about health. It’s about **dignity, confidence, and breaking cycles of silence** that have lasted for generations.
